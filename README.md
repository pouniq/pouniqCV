#### [MNIST number prediction](https://github.com/pouniq/MNIST_CLF/blob/main/MNSIT_classifier_.ipynb)
- A classification model train to predict what number is shown to us.
- the accuracy percentage is 92%.
- i used logistic regression and randomforestclassifier to train the model

#### [titanic survival prediction](https://github.com/pouniq/titanic_prediction_practice/blob/main/titanic.ipynb)
- a classification prediction to survival of a person in the titanic crash
- the accuracy of this model is 80% but it can be better
- we learned gender and wealth have a good correlation to survival of a person
- i used LogisticRegressor for this model


#### [bigmart sales prediction](https://github.com/pouniq/bigmart-sales/blob/main/bigmart_sales_data02.1.ipynb)
